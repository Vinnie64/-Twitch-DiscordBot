# Twitch Bot to interact with discord
  This bot was designed to see if a list of users were live on twitch and if they were, send a message in a discord channel. 
  Create a file called creds.py that contains: 
      discordChannelID=''
      discordBotToken=''
      twitchClientID=''
      twitchClientSecret=''
